     HTML newsletters offer various benefits to the companies generating them. Firstly, it helps publishers track the number
      of e-mails that were opened, forwarded or clicked through which in turn helps them gauge the popularity of their product
       or know what interests the readers about their products. Plain text may not capture the readerâ€™s attention due to its boring
        presentation. HTML email newsletters on the other hand have an upper edge in terms of visibility and which distinguishes them
         from the other promotional emails. </p>
